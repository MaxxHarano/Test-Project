## Max's Test Project for Web Dev

This project is going to be a playground where I test out all common web frontend techniques. Including but not limited to:

1. AJAX
2. throttle
3. jQuery
4. Dom-manipulation
5. CSS animation
6. cookie/session

the list goes on

more specificly I would implement possibly all common React Hooks. Including:

- useContext
- useRef
- useMemo
- ...

#### About the theme of this project, I'm still thinking.
